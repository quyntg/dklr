###How to generate model via JAXB?

Locking at example file xsd 

`sample_model.xsd`

This file has four models:

- Regular model `SampleModel.java` In face it was used for reference of field in result model 

- Input model `SampleInputModel.java` It was used for input model, in jax-rs using `@BeanParam` in `@POST` protocol

- Result model `SampleResultsModel.java` Result in list, was formatted follow Kendo syntax

```
{
total : 'value',
data : [
	object
]
}
```
- Detail model 

Using for `@GET` method in the case get detail an object by its identifier

###Some thinks to do after generate model class by jaxb in eclipse

1. Change type `XMLGregorianCalendar` to `java.util.Date` in all class were generated by `JAXB`

2. Change `@XmlElement(name = "ObjectModelName")` to  `@XmlElement(name = "data")` in result models. That must be done for bindling schema (JSON and XML).

3.  If input model,  add annotations      `@DefaultValue(StringPool.BLANK) @FormParam(value = "scope")`. This `scope` is name of field in body or header pass to API.
